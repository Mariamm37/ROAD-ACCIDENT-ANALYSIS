1. # ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS

2. ## OVERVIEW
This project analyzes *Road Accident* data from year 2021- 2022 with an interactive Excel dashboard. The aim is to break down  casualties by severity, vehicle type, and road types while also comparing urban versus rural locations and day versus night patterns. The dashboard highlights where and when accidents are most likely to occur, offering data-driven insights for policymakers and agencies to enhance road safety.

3. ## OBJECTIVES
The dashboard was built to meet the following objectives:
* Track total casualties by severity: Fatal, Serious, and Slight.
* Analyze casualties by vehicle type (cars, buses, motorcycles, etc.).
* Compare monthly casualty trends across 2021 and 2022.
* Identify high-risk road types contributing to casualties.
* Assess casualty distribution by road surface conditions (dry, wet, etc.).
* Relation between Casualties by location (Urban vs Rural) and time (Day vs Night).
* Provided interactive filtering by year, quarter, and location.

4. ## TOOLS USED
* Microsoft Excel - For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* Pivot Tables - For summarizing casualties by severity, vehicle type, road type, location, etc.
* Charts - Visualizing monthly trends, comparisons, and distributions.
* Slicers & Timelines - Enabling interactive filtering by year, quarter, and accident conditions
* Dataset:

5. ## KEY INSIGHTS
* 84% of casualties were slight injuries, with only 2% fatal cases.
* Cars accounted for the highest casualties (333,484K) far more than other vehicle types.
* Single carriageways contributed to the largest number of casualties (413.4k cases).
* More casualties occurred in urban areas (255.9k) than in rural areas (162k).
* Accidents were more common in daylight (305k casualties) compared to darkness (112.9k).

6. ## RECOMMENDATIONS
* Road Safety Campaigns: Awareness programs for urban drivers, especially car users.
* Infrastructure Improvements: Safety upgrades on single carriageways to reduce high casualty rates.
* Lighting Enhancements: Improve road visibility at night to lower darkness-related casualties.
* Policy Measures: Stricter enforcement of speed limits and safety rules in high-risk urban zones.

7. ## CONCLUSIONS
The Road Accident Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of accident patterns and risk factors. It enables policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety agencies to Identify high-risk zones and vehicle types, compare accident patterns over time, and take data-driven decisions for reducing casualties.
